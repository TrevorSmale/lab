# Cilium

Cilium is an open-source networking and security solution for Kubernetes and other containerized environments. It leverages eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) technology to provide high-performance networking, observability, and security features.

## Key Features:

1. Network Connectivity: Provides L3/L4 networking for Kubernetes pods with minimal overhead.

2. Network Security: Implements identity-based security policies (based on pod labels) rather than IP-based rules.

3. eBPF-Powered: Uses eBPF for efficient data processing at the kernel level, improving performance and reducing latency.

4. Observability: Offers tools like Hubble for network monitoring and troubleshooting.

5. Service Mesh Integration: Works seamlessly with service meshes like Istio and Envoy.

6. Policy Enforcement: Supports fine-grained network and API-layer security policies (L7 filtering).
